-----------------What is this?--------------------------------------------------

This is a project that I worked on over the summer for fun. After
spending my first year at DigiPen learning about programming and 
how engines are built I decided to spend my first summer out of school
working on this project to wrap my head around all the different concepts
that make up a game engine. So, this project is essentially a playground for
component-based design, understanding OpenGL, collision detection and resolution,
input, data-driven components using json, and physics systems.

If you have any questions about this project or would like to understand parts of
it better please email me at qsrenniks@gmail.com.
